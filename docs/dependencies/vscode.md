# Visual Studio Code

## Workspace

In the root of this project I have included a .code-workspace file. This file is used by Visual Studio Code to set up the workspace. It is a simple JSON file that contains a list of folders to open in the workspace. This makes it easier to navigate the project.

### How to use

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Click `File` > `Open workspace from file...`
3. Select the `.code-workspace` file

## Extensions

We recommend using the following extensions:

  You can turn on format-on-save by scoping the setting:

  ```json
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  ```
